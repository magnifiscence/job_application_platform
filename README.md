Job Application Platform.
# Developing a web application that allows users to create, view and apply for job listings.

Team members.
i) - Those that are actively going to participate in this project are:
1- TATA DIVINE SHEY
2- John Chimdike.

ii) - Assigned roles per member.
      The Backend Framework, API Documentation Tool and Database is going to be handled by TATA DIVINE SHEY meanwhile the Frontend Framework, Authentication and Authorization will be done by John Chimdike.

iii) - The roles were assigned after a series of brainstorming and careful deliberations on experience and understanding each person has on a particular technology.


Technologies to be implemented.
i) Here are a list of technologies and resources that will be used:
-  Backend Framework resources:
   Django (python)  to handle server-side logic and API endpoints.
- Databases:
   Mysql  to store job listings, applications, and user details.
- Frontend Framework:
   React will be used for interactive user interfaces.
- Authentication & Authorization:
   Django’s built-in authentication system.
- API Documentation Tool:
   Swagger will be used to document and visualize our API endpoints.

ii) Django was used over flask because django is generally used for larger more complex projects like flask that is a good choice for simpler applications and microservices.
React was used over angular and vue because of its potential to reuse components which saves time for developers as they don’t have to rewrite code.


Challenge Statement:
There is massive unemployment  in Africa which is mostly due to lack of information about available job openings. Many people tend to only share job openings to their friends, family and loved ones which I have been a victim of. So we decided to solve this problem by creating a platform where job openings will be available to all with no biases. This will not only be the case in Africa but we intend to extend to all parts of the world to help humanity.


Risks
i) Technical Risks:
Data Security:
Potential risks include data branches, unauthorized access and data loss. Ensuring proper encryption, access controls and secure coding practices is crucial.
Scalability:
Misestimating system demands might lead to poor performance, slow response times and system crashes as the platform grows.
Integration Complexity:
            Integrating with external services, such as payment gateways or third-party APIs, could 
Pose compatibility and communication challenges.
Database Management:
Issues with database design, query performance and storage capacity may lead to inefficiencies and downtime in data retrieval and storage.
Code Quality and Maintenance:
            Inadequate coding practices could lead to technical debt and difficulty in maintaining the
            Platform in the long run.

ii) Non-Technical Risks:
Regulatory Compliance:
Legal issues, privacy concerns and compliance with regional data protection regulations.
Non compliance could lead to legal issues.
Market Demand and Competition:
Misjudging market needs and failing to differentiate our platform from competitors could lead to low adoption and relevance to users.
User Engagement:
Failure to engage and retain users may result in low application platform usage, impacting the platforms effectiveness.
Financial Viability:
Not properly managing the project budget, cost estimations and revenue projections may lead to financial strain and unsustainability.
Reputation and Brand Management:
Negative user experience, inadequate customer support or poor branding could damage the platform’s reputation and standing within the industry.

Infrastructure:
i) Process for Branching and Merging:
- Branching model: we are implementing a branching model called GitFlow where we have separate branches for features releases and hotfixes. Feature branches are created from the develop branch and merged back into develop upon completion.
- Code Reviews: We are establishing a system that requires code reviews for all changes before merging into the develop or main branch.
- Automated Testing: Integrate automated testing with each pull request to ensure that new features have not introduced breaking changes.
- Version Control: Encourage descriptive commit messages and keep the commit history clean and useful for future reference.

ii) Deployment Strategy:
-  Environment Segmentation:
    Utilize separate environments for development, testing, staging and production to ensure a controlled deployment process.
-  Continuous Integration or Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): 
    Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test and deployment processes. Tools like jenkins, CercleCI or Github Actions help automate deployments.
-  Rollback Plan: Ensure a rollback plan is in place in case of deployment issues allowing you to go back to a previous stable version quickly.
-  Containerization: Consider containerizing your application using docker and orchestrating with kubernetes for easy and consistent deployments.


iii) Data Population Strategies:
-  Mock Data for Deployment:
Use mock data to simulate realistic scenarios during development and testing stages when real data is unavailable.
-  Seed Scripts:
Create scripts to seed initial data for development and testing databases, providing a foundation for testing application functionality without affecting actual production data.
-  Data Migration Strategies:
For transitioning to a production environment, use migration scripts to seed initial production data and maintain data consistency across environments.

iv) Tools, Automation and Testing:
-  Unit and Integration Testing:
Pytest framework will be used
-  End-to-End Testing:
Implement ene-to-end testing tools like selenium to simulate user interactions and verify application workflows.
